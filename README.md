# orienteering
This is a school project for course COMP.CS.110 Programming 2: Techniques at Tampere University. I work with Zannatul Ferdous throughout the project.

A program that first reads information concerning orienteering routes from the input file, stores them into  a suitable data structure, and then permits the user to make searches in the data structure in question.
